# FlipDotDisplay
3 old flip dot displays which need some work to get up and running.

They were bought at the Makerfaire Hannover 2016.

The basic schedule for getting them up and running:

-test basic circuit design

-test circuit on larger scale

-build it up/design PCB

-write controller software

-write ESP8266 software for network-integration
